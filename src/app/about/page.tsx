                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                  TraceIT began three years ago when my parents started a small
                  freeze-dried food business and quickly found themselves
                  overwhelmed with the traceability requirements mandated by the
                  Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Safe Food for Canadians
                  Regulations (SFCR).
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                  The administrative work was taking up nearly 40% of their
                  weekly hours. When they looked for software solutions, they
                  received quotes ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 for
                  implementation plus $200-500 monthly fees - prices that were
                  completely disconnected from what a small business could
                  justify spending.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  With my background in software development, I built the first
                  version of TraceIT over a weekend to help track their
                  ingredient lots and production batches. It was basic but
                  immediately cut their paperwork time in half.

                    I built TraceIT with my parents in mind, focusing on
                    simplicity and efficiency. Every feature was designed to
                    minimize the time spent on record-keeping while ensuring
                    complete CFIA compliance.

                    Over three years, we've improved the system based on daily
                    use - adding barcode scanning, one-click recall reports, and
                    supplier management. What used to take days now takes
                    minutes.

                    From day one, I've been committed to making TraceIT
                    affordable for small businesses. The huge gap between what
                    regulators require and what small producers can practically
                    implement is exactly what TraceIT addresses.

                      I began by studying the CFIA requirements in depth and
                      observing my parents' daily workflow to identify the
                      specific challenges they faced. When CFIA requested a mock
                      recall, it took them almost two full days to compile all
                      the necessary information.

                      The first version of TraceIT focused on solving the core
                      traceability requirements: tracking one step back and one
                      step forward, food identification, and record keeping. My
                      parents were the first and most valuable testers,
                      providing immediate feedback on what worked and what
                      didn't.
