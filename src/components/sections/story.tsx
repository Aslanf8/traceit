                  The Beginning
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Three years ago, my parents started a small freeze-dried food
                  business. As they grew, they found themselves spending more
                  and more time managing the CFIA traceability requirements
                  instead of running their business. The administrative work was
                  taking up nearly 40% of their weekly hours.

                  The Problem
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  My parents tracked everything using Excel spreadsheets and
                  paper logs. Each production batch required manually copying
                  ingredient lot numbers, updating multiple files, and
                  cross-referencing previous records. When CFIA requested a mock
                  recall, it took them almost two full days to compile all the
                  necessary information. When they looked for software
                  solutions, they received quotes ranging from $5,000 to $10,000
                  for implementation plus $200-500 monthly fees. These prices
                  were completely disconnected from what a small food business
                  could afford. Most small producers either can't justify this
                  expense or end up paying for complex systems with features
                  they'll never use. This huge gap between what regulators
                  require and what small businesses can practically implement is
                  exactly what TraceIT addresses.

                  The Solution
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  I built the first version of TraceIT over a weekend to help
                  track their ingredient lots and production batches. It was
                  basic but immediately cut their paperwork time in half. Over
                  three years, we've improved it based on their daily use -
                  adding barcode scanning, one-click recall reports, and
                  supplier management. What used to take days now takes minutes.

                  The Mission
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Now that TraceIT has been tested in a real business for three
                  years, I'm making it available to other Canadian food
                  producers who face the same challenges. I'm not a large
                  company with investors or sales teams - just someone who
                  solved a problem and wants to share that solution with others
                  who might find it useful.
